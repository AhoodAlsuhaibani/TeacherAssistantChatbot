# TeacherAssistantChatbot
This project developed a chatbot to assist students in the T5 Bootcamp program. Trained on T5 presentations, notebooks, and external resources, the chatbot answers student questions about T5 concepts 24/7 via Telegram.  This chatbot empowers students to learn at their own pace and clarify doubts outside of scheduled sessions.
